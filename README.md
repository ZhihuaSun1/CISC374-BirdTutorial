Background cloud particle effect Use particle system to generate dynamic clouds to add layers to the game background.

Bird Wings Animation Create a bird wing flapping animation to increase the dynamic performance of the bird.

Smooth Background Scrolling Add a multi-layer background, each layer scrolls at a different speed to create depth of field and three-dimensional feeling.

Moving Pipes In addition to the fixed position of some pipes, they can also move slowly left and right to increase the challenge of the player.

Score Combo System When the player passes through the pipeline continuously, the player will be rewarded with a combo or score bonus to enhance the challenge of the game.

Energy Props Add random props, such as short invincibility, acceleration or score doubling, to increase the game strategy.

Bird Death Effect When the bird hits the pipe or flies out of the screen, it will play an exploding or scattering particle effect to enhance the feedback of the game.
